# 🎮 Flinch Ball – Neon Reflex Game

Hi, I’m **Shreya Pawar**, a Computer Science student who loves designing interactive and visually appealing web experiences. I created this game to combine creativity, logic, and fun — just a glowing little side project made for entertainment and skill-building.

**Flinch Ball** is a neon-themed reflex game where your goal is to keep the glowing ball alive by dodging obstacles. The gameplay is simple, but the vibe is electric ✨

## 🌟 About the Project

Flinch Ball was built entirely from scratch to practice JavaScript logic and creative UI design. The glowing visuals, floating effects, and smooth gameplay were all manually designed without any libraries or frameworks.

This project helped me explore:
- Canvas-based animation
- Game loop and collision logic
- Responsive CSS styling
- UX flows (name input → play → retry)
